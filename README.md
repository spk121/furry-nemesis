Hi.  This program renders a file named "tmp.midi", which you must provide,
into a file named "tmp.wav".

It is really slow.  Sorry about that.  I'm using a primitive method to
generate the wav files, keeping too much data in memory.  I'll make it
more efficient when I get some spare time.

It doesn't handle pitch-wheel changes or tempo changes, so songs that use
the pitch wheel will sound very odd.
